in UserAccountDropdown.jsx

step-by-step in your UserAccountDropdown.jsx
1. Initial render
open (from useState) is false → dropdown is hidden.

The useEffect runs after this first render.

Inside useEffect, it checks if (open) → since open is false, it does not add the event listener.

The cleanup function exists but won’t remove anything because no listener was added.

2. Click account icon
setOpen(true) runs → triggers a re-render.

Now dropdown content is visible because open is true.

After rendering, useEffect runs again:

if (open) is true, so it adds the mousedown listener to the document.

That listener calls handleClickOutside whenever you click anywhere on the page.

3. Click somewhere outside dropdown
Browser detects a mousedown event → calls handleClickOutside.

Inside handleClickOutside:

Checks if (dropdownRef.current && !dropdownRef.current.contains(event.target)) → meaning:

If you clicked outside the dropdown, set open to false.

When open changes to false, a re-render happens:

Before running the new useEffect, React runs the cleanup function → removes the mousedown listener.

4. Hooks working together
useState → manages whether dropdown is open or closed.

useEffect → manages adding/removing the event listener based on open.

useRef → keeps a pointer to the dropdown DOM element so we can check where the click happened.

 ie : const dropDownRef=useRef(Null)   // initial make the empty store
      <div ref={dropDownRef}  >        // assigning and point this <div> to the the useRef hook

      dropDownRef.current // to access the stored/pointed DOM element
